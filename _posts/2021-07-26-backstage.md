You bled all over the bed backstage, but we pushed you out anyway. Hamlet’s mom got her period, never mind the old age: that’s how we explained it away. Your nose, flat and stuffed with grief, you’d blow it between every other line as you pushed yourself away from Hamlet (we never see him outside of rehearsals, do we?) but he was sobbing, really sobbing, his head on your legs where the audience could see, the colors Caravaggio-like, his tears snaking through his acne and stubs. The stubs ruined it all. I told them, multiple times, that Hamlet should be clean-shaven, and he should wear eyeliner. 

You were seventeen and regal. You looked menopausal. He’s so close to the blood down your legs, into the bed. And why were you bleeding? No, he didn’t do it right. If I were to act, Hamlet would be a girl, of course. 

You wouldn’t know, but that stage was really dirty. You could only see all the dust, dead plastic, bits of props broken off, paper shreds, wet spots of spit glowing on the floor, when there was light upon them. While you were out there making these middle-classed, middle-aged, and muffled relatives of ours cry, I would doze off underneath the corduroy curtains, count the stains on the satin, and someone would be making out near the stage door, and Ms. Stern would be like, pull yourself together, next scene, next scene. It’s a lot back here, in case you didn’t know. I etched your name into the floor, to cope.

It was raining so we had the cast pizza party backstage. You sat where I used to sit when you’re on stage, devouring your slice with a frown. I wondered what your troubles were (I couldn’t even begin to imagine -- you were so beautiful), but I couldn’t bring myself to look at you at all. Backstage, there were these little note cards about how Shakespeare meant to outline the infinity of the human condition through the catharsis of tragedy. But into all the mess, the buzz, the blood, and now the pizza grease, we see nothing, nothing despite. I was going to go home and play video games, and you would go and probably cry about some guy who didn’t like you for how your nose looked. 

I spent half a year watching you from back here and learned nothing for myself. But you spent five nights saying lines you did not mean nor understand. Thereafter, I would jump at every half-hearted mention of Hamlet and Gertrude, thinking about how I dozed off and how you bled. I often wished that I had brighter eyes back then.
