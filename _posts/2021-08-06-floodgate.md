Where do I put my shoes? Where do I throw this away? Where is the sink, the trash, the toilet? Where can I sit -- anywhere? And since when did it start to get dark so early, so softly, and is it time for me to go? Where are these cars racing off to, driving like fish with divine fury, on this shoddy street by your window? Where are your housemates and your neighbors on this Friday night? Where is the music coming from?

Where was the restaurant you picked up dinner from? (Was it far?) Where did you get this lamp, where did you find this plate? Where do I leave my plates, and do you need any help with them? Where did I put my water bottle, my glasses, my phone? And now, where would you like me to sit? By the table, by the desk? On the couch, on the bed? 

Where are you from, and home is where? From where did you and I, having cut our previous lives short, pour into New Haven like flood water, bringing infestations of our own? Where did we first meet, if you still remember? Where did you first open your eyes and see the colors and ideas you would guard to your death? Where should I leave all the things I know with you, and will you duel me for them?

Where are you going next, and where should I be? Where will I find you next, in thunder, lightning, or rain? Where can we be adorned in wreaths by crowds straight out of the floodgates, and where can we be left alone? Where in the world can we be the bitter people we are, in peace? (Not here, in this apartment of plastered white walls? Not here, since your lease ends on the fifteenth? Not here, surely? ) 

Where will someone drive by at night, when we are giddy and beneath a streetlight? Someone holy and just and baser than us, asking with all sincerity: where to, ladies?
