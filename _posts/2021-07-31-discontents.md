In this room we are ageless. We are four and lying blind drunk on this black sofa, cuddling like centenarians on their deathbeds, and we are here on some school trip and I am refusing to believe many things at once. I am not beautiful, in the way that bodies don’t have gravity, in the way nighttime refuses to shave off unwanted streetlights. I am not wanted, in the way toothbrushes are not wanted because you already have one, in the way I am blind to all the ways of wanting, popsicles, movies, garage rock, coffee. I am not going anywhere or becoming anyone. I am starting to be unhappy in the way girls are unhappy. 

I am not in school, not primary, middle, high. Not employed, heartbroken, worshipped. Not friendly, gnarly, saintly. Not entirely not archetypal. I am deliberately not waking up. I am not hydrated nor secure. I am not negations, affirmations, you’ll be okays, I am not ungrateful, ungrown. I am not who I am not. I am not waiting for anything to come.

Let the days pass. Put the change back into the tip jar. Let everything hollow ring out into truth. Let Rilke shake you (“let everything happen… beauty and terror… no feeling is final…”) but he is dead and living is forever. So let it happen if you must. Throw down, drink up. Categorically refuse. Let it be known that I will, I will, and I will. Let the future roll over me, like my tongue rolls an unfamiliar syllable, abashed, not knowing that it means love.

I am always where I am not. I raise my eyes up into the world, where all is bare, bare, bare, and I think, uh oh, it’s not enough!

I am still ageless, perhaps four years old and dreaming. I am making myself think about having jobs and a family the way people make their eldest son think about things. I think about pins and needles and waking up thirty years old in a bigger bed. I think about when I first started to notice other people. My mind is usually mush save for thinking up words. Why don’t I move to Connecticut, America and write prose poems for a living.
