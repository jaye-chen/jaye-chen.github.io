no actually IÂ 
do know better these things
that seeth and turn us.
I make my own maps
from eye to eye to gaps of mouth
with arete and patria wordless,
those girls before our time
ached with bells in rapture,
and too reached for each other
in waters teething and absolute,
with dark and no sight to understand.
their bodies, too like you and I 
took shape only in an other's grasp,
and I thought I'd reach for you the same.
but you, arrested in pose
a vine in petrol against walls
merely see truth, and fall back 
into trance, my hand in yours.
I repeat nothing in your body,
I tremor and want and toughen up.
That I spin and cast my arm and trust
you'd come up with something old for us
